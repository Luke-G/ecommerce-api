This is a repository for me to demonstrate knowledge of various API concepts and technologies. I will be starting from scratch and working on implementing each of the core concepts I have chosen over time. Once I have a functional system, I will use this repository as a base for experimenting with other tools and publish the work here.

**E-commerce API**

Goal: to have a functional system with diagrams and an in-depth explanation of the system design and components. Demonstrate core knowledge and understanding of each selected concept.

Brief: create an ecommerce API which can be used be companies to sell products to customers in a single centralised online store.
